# OCR from Scratch with Python


## Description


OCR from Scratch with Python
This project implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from scratch using Python libraries. It aims to recognize text characters from images without relying on pre-trained models.

## Demo

## Key Features

- Customizable: Train the model on your specific datasets and fonts for better accuracy.
- Open-source: Built with freely available Python libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional).
- Educational: Gain insights into the fundamental concepts of image processing and character recognition.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Sklearn
- Flask
- Tensorflow
Ensure you have the required dependencies 


## Usage/Examples

### 1. Run the Flask server
./ocr_webapp
```bash
python app.py
```

### Notes
You can also playaround with the scripts to train your own model with your own dataset. Every testing and playground scripts are provided.
